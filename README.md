## How It's Made:

**Front end:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript

**Back end:** Node, Express, Pug, MongoDB, Mongoose, Cloudinary

Users can look at poems shared by others or create an account to post their own.

## Optimizations

- I would like to add 
	- pagination 
	- profile pages 
	- indicator for how many lines and characters there are while writing a poem
	- update poem button

## Lessons Learned:

- I learned how to
	- extend pug layouts and use mixins and partials to make my code more readable and maintainable
	- validate unique user names and emails
	- update existing user's profiles
	- populate posts with user information
	- use multer to handle file uploads
	- use cloudinary to crop, store, and destroy images
